                Six, seven, eight, uh

                Don't you know if you want something new?
                Yeah, you've got things to do

                Highways, drive safe
                I left my troubles at the driveway
                I hit my baby up, then we escape

                We don't know where we are going
                But we ain't going home
                Sometimes you gotta leave what's broken
                Get offline, turn off your phone
                (And now?)

                Crisis at the motel
                And we don't wanna go until we're done
                And even though we smile, things aren't okay
                'Cause baby, oh, the worst is yet to come
                Crisis at the motel
                And we don't know if we'll ever see the sun
                Again, again, again

                I got wheels
                Everything is on the road
                Trust is in the road
                I don't wanna deal, so I'm in the mode
                Passion's in the run
                Just wanna have fun
                I don't like to fix, not my type of shit
                I just want it done, hey

                We don't know where we are going
                But we ain't going home
                Sometimes you gotta leave what's broken
                Get offline, turn off your phone
                (And now?)

                Crisis at the motel
                No, we don't wanna go until we're done
                And even though we smile, things aren't okay
                'Cause baby, oh, the worst is yet to come
                Crisis at the motel
                And we don't know if we'll ever see the sun
                Again, again, again

                If you want something new
                You've got things to do

                Crisis at the motel
